## 0.6.0

**Breaking changes:**
- The names of generated GraphQL types are now capitalized regardless of the terminology.

**New features:**
- `resolvers.resolveSourceTypes` can now return a Promise.

**Miscellaneous:**
- `SemanticGraph#toString` now displays the number of triples in the graph.
- Triples with predicates not used by the lib are not stored in memory.

- Improved tests.

## 0.5.1

**Bug fixes:**
- Bug on `owl:inverseOf` inference that broke the feature in some cases.

## 0.5.0

**Breaking changes:**
- `getIriLocalName` is not exposed/exported by the package anymore.

**New features:**
- On in-graph properties, new `shouldAlwaysUseInverseOf` and `shouldNeverUseInverseOf` config keys to modify the resolver's behavior.

**Bug fixes:**
- `isGraphqlList` is now also infered from `isGraphqlConnection`.
- `preventIdField` config option can now also prevent the Relay id field.

**Miscellaneous:**
- Tests! :tada: (very basic for now)
- Improved documentation.

## 0.4.0

**Breaking changes:**
- `resolvers.resolveSourceTypes` must now be sync.
- Interface type resolving was rolled back on InterfaceTypes (instead of ObjectTypes). Better support, although still incomplete. External ObjectTypes must not provide an `isTypeOf` method anymore, instead external InterfaceTypes must provide a `resolveType` method.

**Bug fixes:**
- Fragile type resolution on interfaces. Will require further work.

**Miscellaneous:**
- Promisify using `Promise.resolve` instead of home-made function. It's slower but safer.

## 0.3.1

**Bug fixes:**
- Warn when traversing graph and encoutering missing vertices.

## 0.3.0

**Breaking changes:**
- Cannot override `relayEdgeType` and `relayConnectionType` anymore. `relayConnectionDefinitions` override added instead.

- Bug concerning the creation of Relay types.

## 0.2.1

**Bug fixes:**
- Fixed a bug concerning the inference of owl:inverseOf.

## 0.2.0

**Breaking changes:**
- Removed `resolvers.resolveSourceClassIri`.
- Added `resolvers.resolveSourceTypes`.
- Interface type resolving now happens on GraphQLObjectTypes. This means that your external GraphQLObjectTypes must provide an `isTypeOf` method.

**New features:**
- Promise support for all resolvers.

**Bug fixes:**
- Fixed `requireGraphqlRelay` behavior.
- Fixed a bug on `SemanticGraph#addFieldOnObjectType`.
- Fixed a bug that happened when inferring owl:inverseOf on properties that are a rdfs:subProperty with no rdfs:range.
